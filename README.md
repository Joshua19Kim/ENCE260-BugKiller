**--The grade of this project was A--**

This was the team project for ENCE260 of second year course in UC.
We creatively designed this by ourselves and programmed.
The pair of UCfunkits have to be used to play this game.
Two kits will have wireless connection and the information will be transmitted and received at the same time based on how the players perform.



Bug Killer.

How to play.
 - Connect the USB cable to your Fun Kit device and your computer.
 - Open the terminal.
 - Enter the directory of the code using the cd console command in the terminal.
 - Load the code on to both UC Fun Kits using 'make program' in the terminal.
 - On your Fun Kit LED screen and your opponent's screen, it should display the scrolling-text 'Bug Killer'.
 - Place them close together with their transmitters and receivers facing each other.
 - Press down the navswitch button to begin the countdown. The game will start!
 - You will see a blinking red LED: this is the killer. The other static red LEDs are the bugs.
 - Move your killer on top of the bugs, using the navswitch, and press down the navswitch to kill them!
 - There are three stages. The first player to kill all the bugs on a particular stage will cause the program to switch jump to the next stage.
 - Continue to kill the bugs as fast as you can on each stage; you are competeting against your opponent.
 - Once stage 3 has finished, the LED screen will display the result of the game.
 - The result is based solely on the total number of bugs killed between the 2 players.
 - If you lose, it'll display 'LOSE!' on your screen, 'WIN!' if you win, or 'TIE!' if the game results in a tie.
 - If you wish to play again, press the white reset button (the one next to the navswitch, S2), then hold down the white button on the other side (S1) and,
   while doing so, press the white reset button again. The program will run and you can play again!

Note.
 - The bugs spawn randomly on the screen and the locations of the bugs on one player's screen may be different to the other player's.
 - When a particular stage starts, the killer may spawn right on top of a bug; you still have to kill this bug!
 - The number of bugs on each stage will be the same for both players.
